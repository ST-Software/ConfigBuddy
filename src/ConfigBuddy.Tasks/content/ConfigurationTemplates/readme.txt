All of your configuration files should be placed here.
1) The folder structure needs to be preserve (that means if you have bin/hibernate.xml it should be placed to ConfigurationTemplates/bin/hibernate.xml and so on)
2) add ".template" sufix to all of your config files (otherwise they will not be processed)
